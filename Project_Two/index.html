      <h3>What are RCPs?</h3>
      <p>RCPs stands for <b>Representative Concentration Pathways</b>.</p>
      <p>Used by IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change) to report on the state of climate change.</p>
      <p>They are scenarios that show the effect of green house gases and other global warming causing chemicals on matters such as temperature, sea level rise, and anything else physical, ecological or socioeconomic, depending on what policies the world adapts and how fast it adapts them. </p>
      <p>Basically based on how much GHG concentrations change in the atmosphere.</p>
      <p>The goal of these scenarios is not to predict the future but to better understand what possible impact different policies have on the earth and human systems. These can be ecosystems, water resources, food security, human health, health equity, population, governance, literacy, etc..</p>
      <p>2.6 - Emission peaks between 2010-2020, then declines. Requires Immediate and intense policies.</p>
      <p>4.5 to 6.0 - Emission peaks between 2040-2060 then declines (Stabilization without overshoot).</p>
      <p>8.5 - Emissions continue to rise the whole 21st century, as it is now, with no policy changes. (business as usual)</p>
      
      <h3>What does this mean for sea levels?</h3>
      <p>Depending on the policies that we take, there are multiple scenarios that could occur at different RCP levels.</p>
      <p>(RCP 2.5) - Required effort: <b>High.</b> Temperature increase: <b>1.0C.</b>  Expected sea level rise: <b>0.4 meters.</b> Cost to adapt: <b>Low.</b></p>
      <p>(RCP 4.5) - Required effort: <b>Medium.</b> Temperature increase: <b>1.8C.</b>  Expected sea level rise: <b>0.47 meters.</b> Cost to adapt: <b>Medium.</b></p>
      <p>(RCP 6.0) - Required effort: <b>Medium.</b> Temperature increase: <b>2.2C.</b>  Expected sea level rise: <b>0.48 meters.</b> Cost to adapt: <b>Medium.</b></p>
      <p>(RCP 8.5) - Required effort: <b>Low.</b> Temperature increase: <b>3.7C.</b>  Expected sea level rise: <b>0.63 meters.</b> Cost to adapt: <b>High.</b></p>
      
      <h3>Where are we now?</h3>
      <p>The 2015 Paris Agreement wants to limit temperature increases to 1.5C by 2100.</p>
      <p>If this can be achieved, it would place us between RCP 2.5 and 4.5, and an expected sea level increase of 0.4-0.47 meters.</p>
      <p>Populations living close to body of waters would for the most part not have to deal with a high price to adapt.</p>
