My project focuses on climate change, and specifically rising sea levels. 
The main concept that I will use to explore this topic is RCPs, which is
short for Representative Concentration Pathways.

I got the idea while I was taking an earth and environmental sciences class
last semester. While I was always interested in climate change, it was
the first time I discovered the topic of RCPs and how relevant they are now
to the future of the planet and human societies. This is the one thing that
stuck with me after taking the class.

They are basically different scenarios that the earth and humans could face
by year 2100 depending on the set of policies and actions that we decide to
take now and on the level of GHGs. Whenever we ask ourselves a specific 
question about what specific thing would happen to the planet that is related
to climate change, RCPs help to tackle this question by offering multiple
scenarios.

// Research Question //
///////////////////////

By how much will sea levels rise by 2100?

Even though this question seems simple, it is actually difficult to answer
because there are a lot of variables that come into play. And depending on
how humans form their policies and how fast energy technologies advance, 
the answer can be very different. In order to accommodate the different
scenarios, I will use RCPs to answer the question.
